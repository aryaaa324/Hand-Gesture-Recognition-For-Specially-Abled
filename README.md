# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-For-Specially-Abled
The hand gesture recognition system for specially abled individuals represents a significant leap towards enhancing communication and interaction capabilities. This system harnesses the power of machine learning, specifically employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to translate hand gestures into text. 
CNNs are chosen for their exceptional ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from image data, capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns at different scales, which is crucial for recognizing the intricate movements of hand gestures.
